This is more of a steam of consciousness text to journal about today. I got out of bed at around 10 & ate lunch before heading to office hours to work on a project. After that, I learned how to use Docker & got some coffee- it was really good. Finally, I went home & watched some videos before studying for the upcoming midterm. The End.
